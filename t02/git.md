First, let's start with the basic operations of GIT:

1. **Git Clone**: This operation creates a copy of a repository.

   Example: `git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git`

2. **Git Add**: This operation adds a change in the working directory to the staging area.

   Example: `git add filename` or `git add .` to add all changes

3. **Git Commit**: This operation saves your changes to the local repository.

   Example: `git commit -m "Commit message"`

4. **Git Push**: This operation sends the committed changes of the local repository to a remote repository.

   Example: `git push origin master`

5. **Git Pull**: This operation fetches and merges changes on the remote server to your working directory.

   Example: `git pull origin master`

6. **Git Branch**: This operation allows you to create, list and delete branches.

   Examples: 
   - Create a new branch: `git branch new_branch`
   - List all branches: `git branch`
   - Delete a branch: `git branch -d branch_name`

7. **Git Checkout**: This operation switches branches or restoresworking tree files.

   Examples: 
   - Switch to an existing branch: `git checkout branch_name`
   - Create a new branch and switch to it: `git checkout -b new_branch`

8. **Git Merge**: This operation merges the specified branchâ€™s history into the current branch.

   Example: `git merge branch_name`

Now, let's take a look at how you might handle a conflict during a merge:

1. First, let's create a new branch and make a change:

   ```
   git checkout -b feature_branch
   echo "This is some new feature." > feature.txt
   git add feature.txt
   git commit -m "Adding new feature"
   ```

2. Now switch back to master and make a conflicting change:

   ```
   git checkout master
   echo "This is a change on master." > feature.txt
   git add feature.txt
   git commit -m "Changing feature on master"
   ```

3. Try to merge feature_branch into master:

   ```
   git merge feature_branch
   ```

   You'll see a message that there's a conflict.

4. Open feature.txt and you'll see something like this:

   ```
   <<<<<<< HEAD
   This is achange on master.
   =======
   This is some new feature.
   >>>>>>> feature_branch
   ```

5. The part between `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======` is what's on the current branch (master), and the part between `=======` and `>>>>>>> feature_branch` is what's on the branch you're trying to merge (feature_branch).

6. To resolve the conflict, decide which part to keep, remove the other part along with the `<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>> feature_branch` markers, and save the file. 

   For example, you decide to keep the change on master:

   ```
   This is a change on master.
   ```

7. After resolving the conflict, commit the changes:

   ```
   git add feature.txt
   git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict"
   ```

8. Now the merge conflict is resolved and you can push your changes to the remote repository:

   ```
   git push origin master
   ```

This is a very basic demonstration and in real projects, conflicts might be more complex. But the general process to resolve them is the same.
