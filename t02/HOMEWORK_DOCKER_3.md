## Question

Try spin up the service follow the README file. repo from docker related repo in https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=dockerised&s=stars&type=Repositories

## Answer
### General Steps
On the general steps to do it:

1. **Clone the repository**: Find the repository you are interested in and clone it onto your local machine using `git clone <repository url>`.

2. **Read the README file**: The README file usually contains specific instructions on how to set up and run the project. It's important to read this thoroughly.

3. **Install Docker**: Make sure Docker is installed and running on your machine. If it's not, you can download it from the Docker official website and follow the installation guide.

4. **Build the Docker image**: Most Docker-based projects contain a Dockerfile, you can use this to build a Docker image using the command `docker build -t <your-image-name> .`

5. **Run the Docker container**: After building the image, you can run the container using `docker run -d -p <host-port>:<container-port> <your-image-name>`

6. **Use Docker Compose**: If the project contains a `docker-compose.yml` file, you can use Docker Compose to manage the application. Use the command `docker-compose up` to start the services defined in the file.

Remember, the exact commands and steps can vary depending on the specifics of the repository and the application. Always refer to the README or other provided documentation for the most accurate instructions.

### A Case
Example for https://github.com/django-cms/django-cms-quickstart

Start docker




#### Reason why fail with git@
Notes
The difference between `git@` and `https://` is the method used to connect to the repository. 

- `git@github.com:<username>/<repository>.git`: This is an SSH URL. SSH URLs provide access to a Git repository via SSH, a secure protocol. To use an SSH URL, you will need to have an SSH key set up on your local machine and added to your GitHub account. The error you're seeing (`Permission denied (publickey)`) suggests that you either don't have an SSH key set up on your machine, or the key hasn't been associated with your GitHub account.

- `https://github.com/<username>/<repository>.git`: This is an HTTPS URL. HTTPS URLs connect to GitHub repositories over HTTPS, a secure protocol that doesn't require any special setup. When you clone a repository with an HTTPS URL, you'll be asked for your GitHub username and password (or a personal access token if you have two-factor authentication enabled). The clone operation you did using the HTTPS URL worked because it doesn't require any additional setup.

In summary, the reason the first clone attempt failed is likely because your local machine's SSH key wasn't set up correctly with GitHub. The second attempt succeeded because HTTPS doesn't require any special setup
