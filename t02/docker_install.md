Key differences summarized based on the provided information:

Installation Compatibility:

Docker Desktop for Linux is intended for Linux-based systems.
Docker Engine is also compatible with Linux but doesn't provide a dedicated graphical interface like Docker Desktop.
Storage Isolation:

Docker Desktop for Linux isolates containers and images within a virtual machine (VM). This isolation prevents interference with other Docker Engine installations on the same machine.
Docker Engine for Linux runs containers natively on the host system and stores them in the host's file system.
Resource Controls:

Docker Desktop for Linux offers controls to restrict the resources allocated to it within the VM.
Docker Engine for Linux can have resource controls configured at the container level but typically doesn't have inherent resource controls for the Docker daemon itself.
This information clarifies that Docker Desktop for Linux is designed to provide a user-friendly interface and isolation for containers on Linux systems, making it suitable for development and testing environments. In contrast, Docker Engine for Linux is often used in production environments and may require manual resource management.
