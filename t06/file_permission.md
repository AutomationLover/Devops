Here explain Linux file permissions and the chmod command.

In Linux, file permissions control who can read, write, or execute files. They are typically shown as a set of three numbers, with each number representing different access levels for the user, the group, and others, respectively.

The chmod command (which stands for "change mode") is used to change these permissions. The number following chmod represents the permissions you wish to set.

The number is calculated using a simple system:

- 4 stands for "read",
- 2 stands for "write",
- 1 stands for "execute",
- 0 stands for "no permissions".

You can add these numbers together to get different permissions. For example, 7 (4+2+1) would give read, write, and execute permissions.

In your command, `chmod 400 ~/.ssh/key.pem`, 

- 4 (read) for the user (you),
- 0 (no permissions) for the group,
- 0 (no permissions) for others.

That means only the file owner will have the "read" permission, while the members of the file's group and others will have no permissions to read, write, or execute the file.

This command is often used for files that contain sensitive information - in this case, `key.pem` likely being a private key. This level of restriction (400) ensures that this sensitive information can only be read by the user/owner, and cannot be accidentally written to or executed, minimizing the risk of accidental damage or exposure.
