# How to Install Docker on a MacBook

## Step 1: Download Docker
- Go to the official Docker website: [Docker Website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- Click **Get Docker** to start the download.

## Step 2: Install Docker
- Find a file named **Docker.dmg** in your downloads and double-click it.
- You'll see the Docker icon and a message to drag this icon into the Applications folder. Follow this instruction.

## Step 3: Run Docker
- Open your **Applications** folder and double-click the Docker app.
- The Docker icon will appear on your top menu bar, which means Docker is now running.

## Step 4: Verify Installation
- Open a terminal window.
- Type `docker --version` and press **enter**. This should display the Docker version.

## Step 5: Docker Account
- If you don't have one, create a Docker account on Docker's website.
- You'll need this to download images from Docker Hub. 

## Step 6: Check Docker Samples
- Open a terminal window.
- Type `docker run hello-world` and press **enter**. Docker will download a test image, run it in a container, and display a "Hello from Docker!" message to confirm your installation.

**Note:** Always keep your Docker app updated for the latest features and security improvements. You can do this by clicking the Docker icon in the menu bar and choosing "Check for Updates".

**Final Note:** Docker requires at least 4GB of RAM and runs only on macOS version 10.14 (Mojave) or newer. Please make sure your system meets these requirements.
