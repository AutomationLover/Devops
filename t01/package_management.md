**Package Management**

Package Management refers to a set of tools designed to automate the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing software packages for a computer's operating system in a consistent manner. It typically maintains a database of software dependencies and version information to prevent software mismatches and missing prerequisites. 

Now let's go over the different package managers:

1. **Linux**
    - **apt (Advanced Package Tool):** This is the package manager used by Ubuntu and other Debian-based distributions. It handles packages in the .deb format.

    Demo: 
    ```
    # To install a package
    sudo apt-get install <package-name>

    # To update the package list
    sudo apt-get update

    # To upgrade all installed packages
    sudo apt-get upgrade

    # To search for a package
    apt-cache search <search-term>

    # To list all packages
    dpkg --list
    ```

    - **yum (Yellowdog Updater, Modified):** This is the default package manager used by Red Hat, CentOS, and Fedora. It handles packages in the .rpm format.

    Demo: 
    ```
    #To install a package
    sudo yum install <package-name>

    # To update all packages
    sudo yum update

    # To search for a package
    yum search <search-term>

    # To list all installed packages
    yum list installed
    ```

    - **dnf (Dandified YUM):** This is the next-generation version of YUM used by Fedora, Red Hat, and CentOS. It also handles .rpm packages but is designed to be more reliable and offer improved performance.

    Demo: 
    ```
    # To install a package
    sudo dnf install <package-name>

    # To update all packages
    sudo dnf update

    # To search for a package
    dnf search <search-term>

    # To list all installed packages
    dnf list installed
    ```

2. **Mac**
    - **Homebrew (brew):** This is the most popular package manager for macOS. It simplifies the installation of software on Apple's macOS operating system and Linux.

    Demo: 
    ```
    # To install a package
    brew install <package-name>

    # To update Homebrew and all packages
    brew update && brew upgrade

    # To search fora package
    brew search <search-term>

    # To list all installed packages
    brew list
    ```

Remember to replace `<package-name>` and `<search-term>` with the package you want to install or the term you want to search for, respectively.
